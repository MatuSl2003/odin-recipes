     Homemade salted potato chips! Crunchy, cheap and may I say, addictive as f***.
    </p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>
        STEP 1 Peel and wash your potatoes
    </p>
    <p> 
        STEP 2 Cut them with a slicer, so as to make them thin-ish
    </p>
    <p>
        STEP 3 Put oil on a tray, either olive or sunflower (not car one), and place the potato chips with some salt seasoning, you may add extra seasoning if you wish
    </p>
    <p>
        STEP 4 Cook them for about 10-15 mintes at medium heat and check them for crunchyness, not too little nor too much
